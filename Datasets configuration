TASK 2
For the dataset wage2 fit a regression log(wage) on age, IQ & south. Evaluate R^2 and Radj^2. Round the answer to tree decimal places.





TASK 3
For the dataset sleep75 consider a regression sleep ~ totwrk + I(totwrk^2) + yngkid + marr + union. Fit the model and test overall significance of the model.
Calculate test statistic, critical value and make inferences. Round the answer to 3 decimal places. Significant level is 5%. Use non-robust covariance matrix estimator





TASK 4
For the dataset TableF5-1, estimate the logit regression LFP~WE+KL6+K618+CIT+UN+np.log(FAMINC). Test the significance of the coefficient on KL6. 
Provide the test statistic, critical value, and conclusion. Round your answers to 2 decimal places. Significance level: 5%.





TASK 5
For the dataset TableF5-1, estimate the probit regression LFP~WA+I(WA**2)+CIT+UN+np.log(FAMINC). Test the joint significance of ['CIT', 'UN'] using the Wald test.
Provide the test statistic, critical value, and conclusion. Round your answers to 2 decimal places. Significance level: 5%.





TASK 6
For the dataset sleep75 consider a regression sleep ~ totwrk + I(totwrk^2) + south + male + smsa + marr. Fit the model and test the significance of male, smsa, marr.
Calculate test statistic, critical value and make inferences. Round the answer to 3 decimal places. Significant level is 10%. Use non-robust covariance matrix estimator
